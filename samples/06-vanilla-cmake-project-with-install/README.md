# Sample

## Using the `CMake` install functionality and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

This sample creates a project call `install_project` which is installed to the cmake prefix path `/prefix_dir`.  

Then another project uses this installed library to run a simple addition.


## Usage

See `test.cmake`
