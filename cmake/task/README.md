# Tasks and Promises


## Motivation 

As a build system CMake hast to do alot with long running tasks, especially when using external programs in the build or configuration process. E.g. checking out a dependency repository, uploading a large file ...

I needed a system which allows me to do some parallel work and split larger tasks into smaller independent tasks. 


header 1 | header 2 | header 3
---------|----------|---------
value 1 | value2 | value3

## Example

```cmake
```
